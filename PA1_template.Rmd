  #A Loading and preprocessing the data
  #1. Load the data (i.e. 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍.𝚌𝚜𝚟())

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

  #1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
  library(plyr)

  #3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
  meanOfTotalNumStepsPerDay <- mean(numStepsPerDay$totalNumberOfSteps, na.rm = TRUE)
